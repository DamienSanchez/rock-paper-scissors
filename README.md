# Rock-Paper-Scissors 
This is the Rock, Paper, Sicssors project by The Odin Project coded by Damien Sanchez.

This Game is played by one human player and one computer player. **Man VS Machine**. Who will win?

# My notes through out the project:
I will be taking notes on things that confused me or that gave me the Ah-ha! moment. I will Also list any resource that I used throuht the project.

* Used [W3 School Arrays](w3school.com/js/js_array.asp) to hold a 'list' of chocies
* It was hard for to come up with the playRound() logic
* By writing some psuedo code it actually helped!!
* I notice that when taking user input that somtime is the word is in all caps it will defualt to the computer winning everytime.
    So to combat this before the user input in applied to the logic I converted it to all lower case to match what is in the array.
* For me getting the logic right for the conter and having the counter be able to be used in multpul function was a challege... 
    Dont be afriad to google!
